A Java-based ICS (internet chess server).

**We desperately need Java developers to continue on with the project.
There might be no more development on Morphy until more join.**

Features include:
  * Non-blocking io.
  * MySQL and Apache Derby support. (Currently using MySQL - Derby support is no longer used or tested)
  * Many commands implemented


Currently seeking Java developers. If you are interested contact someone on the team.

The back-end board/position/game library is now open source. See http://code.google.com/p/javachesslib/ for details.

Commands needing to be implemented (I put them in here as I remember them, this is not comprehensive) (I'd put this in a Wiki but I don't want it to make a source commit every time I change it):
```
eco
ping
getgame
seek
play
showa
showsr
sought
copy
forward
backward
```
